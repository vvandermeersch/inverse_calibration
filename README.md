This repository contains the manuscript files, R code and data that were used in our study on inverse calibration.

* `data_compilation` contains (i) the code to download hourly _ERA5-Land_ data and compile them to daily data as required by PHENOFIT model, (ii) the code to compute WHC from _EU-SoilHydroGrids_ and _SoilGrids_ databases, as well as (iii) the code to sample occurrence data  
* `cmaes_calibration` contains the code to run a calibration using CMA-ES calibration on several cores
* `data` contains occurrence subsets used in our study, as well as some climate data
