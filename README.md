This repository contains the manuscript files, R code and data that were used in our study on inverse calibration.

* `climate_compilation` contains the code to download hourly _ERA5-Land_ data, and compile them to daily data as required by PHENOFIT model, as well as the script to compute WHC from _EU-SoilHydroGrids_ and _SoilGrids_ databases  
* `cmaes_calibration` contains the code to run a calibration using CMA-ES calibration on several cores
* `data` contains occurrence subsets used in our study, as well as some climate data
