This folder contains the R code that was used to run CMA-ES calibration on the GenOuest cluster.  
Using _Slurm_ workload manager, the bash script `calibration.sh` was used to run the R script `calibration.R` on 40 cores.  
Note that `process_files` and `output_files` are only for illustration purposes.
